# Python Election Audit

## Overview

The purpose of this election audit was to determine which candidate won the election, how many votes they received, and what percentage of the total votes cast those votes represented. In addition it was requested that, using the counties provided in the voter records, we create a breakdown of how many votes were cast in each county and which county had the overall largest voter turnout.

## Election Audit Summary

This code could be applied to any election in the future with minimal changes. The file path would need to be changed to the relevant election results:

For future elections the row indexes would need to be updated to reflect the order of the current file:
